If standard output is redirected to a terminal, stdio library employs
line-buffered IO by default. Because end of the string printed by printf is a
newline, stdio will call write() to immediately flush its buffer to kernel
buffer, guaranteeing that the first string goes before the second.

If standard output is redirected to a file, stdio library employs full-buffered
IO by default. Most of the time, the short string printed by printf will not
cause the stdio buffer to be flushed and thus will go after the second.
